AI is a rapidly growing field of computer science and engineering, which has its roots in the development of machine learning algorithms and neural networks. Some of the key applications of AI include natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and autonomous systems. AI technology is used in a wide range of industries, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and manufacturing, to improve efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making.",

    "AI.AP1":"TensorFlow is an open-source software library developed by Google Brain Team that is used for building and training machine learning models. It was initially released in 2015 and has since become one of the most popular libraries for machine learning and deep learning.",
    "AI.AP2":"TensorFlow allows users to build and train models using various machine learning techniques such as deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. It provides a flexible and efficient platform for implementing these techniques, and can run on a variety of platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and even mobile devices.",
    "AI.AP3":"In addition to its core machine learning capabilities, TensorFlow also provides tools and libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and high-level APIs for building and deploying machine learning models. TensorFlow is widely used in both academia and industry, and has been used to develop applications in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and robotics.",
    "AI.WebGl":"WebGL is Not Supported?",
    "AI.A3":"Some users are reportedly unable to use WebGL-based sites like WebGL Earth, Shadertoy, etc. The message that comes up is ‘WebGL is not supported‘. Although the message is much more common with Google Chrome, it’s also confirmed to appear with other browsers (Opera & Firefox). The issue is not exclusive to a certain Windows version, but it’s mostly reported to occur with systems using an older GPU model.",

Original <a rel='canonical' href='https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models'>ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco model</a> size is 187.8 MB and can be downloaded from tensorflow model zoo. Compared to original model, Tensorflow.js version of the model is very lightweight and optimized for browser execution. The default object detection model for Tensorflow.js COCO-SSD is ‘lite_mobilenet_v2’ which is very very small in size, under 1MB, and fastest in inference speed. If you would like better classification accuracy you can use ‘mobilenet_v2’, in this case the size of the model increases to 75 MB which is not suitable for web-browser experience."
